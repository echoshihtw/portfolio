    "I have been painting since 2012, mostly in Tainan. I studied Italian language and culture at Fu Jen Catholic University in Taipei, and after I finished I spent three months at Accademia del Giglio in Florence.",
    "The clay bust, the pasta painting and the charcoal head were made there. The ink drawing of a mouth was made on a plane, and the airport is Jakarta.",

  // The torn-paper edge from Echo's edited version, grafted onto the colour
  // of the untouched photograph (scripts/graft.swift: alpha from one image,
  // RGB from the other, in pixel space). The edited file had the edge she
  // wanted but had been re-rendered, sharper than the original and with
  // detail that was never photographed.
  //
  // Transparent rather than flattened onto a page colour, because it now
  // sits on the home page, which has two themes.
